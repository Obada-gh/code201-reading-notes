## How the Web Works (visualization)
When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

## Structure : its the page how its looks these are main pionts you need to understand :
* There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.
* Ordered lists use numbers.
* Unordered lists use bullets.
* Definition lists are used to define terminology.
* Lists can be nested inside one another.

## Domain Modeling :
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

* When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
* Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
* Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
* Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
* Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
* Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
example:

![domain](https://www12.0zz0.com/2021/03/07/15/244382034.png).

## Chapter 6: “Tables” (pp.126-145) :

* The `<table>` element is used to add tables to a web
page.
* A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the `<tr>` element.
* Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the `<td>` element (or `<th>` if it is a
header).
* You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
* For long tables you can split the table into a `<thead>`,
`<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`.


example:

## Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)

* Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.
* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.
* An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
* In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
* Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.
* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).

## Cheats sheet :

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formaing words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.you just need to make a file with .md extension on Vs code and good to go with this cheats sheet:



 HEADERS : 

```

    # This is an <h1> tag
    ## This is an <h2> tag
    ##### This is an <h6> tag

```
list :
```
     orderd:
         1. Item 1
         2. Item 2
         3. Item 3
     unorder:    

         * Item 3a
         * Item 3b

 ```  
EMPHASIS :
```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_
**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__
*You **can** combine them*
```
BLOCKQUOTES :
```
> I’ve always been more interested
> in the future than in the past.
```
> I’ve always been more interested
> in the future than in the past.

IMAGES :

table :
```
First Header | Second Header
----------- | -------------

## The seven rules of a great Git commit message:
* Keep in mind: This has all been said before.
* Separate subject from body with a blank line.
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
* Capitalize the subject line.
* Do not end the subject line with a period.
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
* Wrap the body at 72 characters.
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.
