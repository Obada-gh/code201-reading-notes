# Code 201 Reading Notes
hallo there i will sumorize for you some concepts that i learned from html-css book and JS book and How to Write a Git Commit Message from additional resources.
>in the end there is a quiz for you and a map for our info. &#128175;



## How the Web Works (visualization)
When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

## Structure : its the page how its looks these are main pionts you need to understand :
* There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.
* Ordered lists use numbers.
* Unordered lists use bullets.
* Definition lists are used to define terminology.
* Lists can be nested inside one another.

## CHART.JS

Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

* Setting up :
The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js. Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory you’ll be working in. Then create a new html page and import the script:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Chart.js demo</title>
        <script src='Chart.min.js'></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```
* Drawing a line chart
`<canvas id="buyers" width="600" height="400"></canvas>`

* Creating a Chart :
It's easy to get started with Chart.js. All that's required is the script included in your page along with a single <canvas> node to render the chart.

In this example, we create a bar chart for a single dataset and render that in our page. You can see all the ways to use Chart.js in the usage documentation.

Chart.js is available under the MIT license.

* Conclusion:
The great things about Chart.js are that it’s simple to use and really very flexible. Plus, once you’ve mastered the basics here, you’ll discover that there are tons of options listed in the documentation.

            var income = document.getElementById("income").getContext("2d");
            // draw bar chart
            new Chart(income).Bar(barData);
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```



## Canvas :

* Basic usage of canvas:

The `<canvas>` element :
```
<canvas id="tutorial" width="150" height="150"></canvas>
```
* Fallback content :
```
<canvas id="stockGraph" width="150" height="150">
  current stock price: $3.15 + 0.15
</canvas>

<canvas id="clock" width="150" height="150">
  <img src="images/clock.png" width="150" height="150" alt=""/>
</canvas>
```
* The rendering context :
```
var canvas = document.getElementById('tutorial');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
```
* Checking for support:
```
var canvas = document.getElementById('tutorial');

if (canvas.getContext) {
  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  // drawing code here
} else {
  // canvas-unsupported code here
}
```
* example:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
  <meta charset="utf-8"/>
  <script type="application/javascript">
    function draw() {
      var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
      if (canvas.getContext) {
        var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

        ctx.fillStyle = 'rgb(200, 0, 0)';
        ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 50, 50);

        ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(0, 0, 200, 0.5)';
        ctx.fillRect(30, 30, 50, 50);
      }
    }
  </script>
 </head>
 <body onload="draw();">
   <canvas id="canvas" width="150" height="150"></canvas>
 </body>
</html>
```
* The grid:
Before we can start drawing, we need to talk about the canvas grid or coordinate space. Our HTML skeleton from the previous page had a canvas element 150 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. To the right, you see this canvas with the default grid overlayed. Normally 1 unit in the grid corresponds to 1 pixel on the canvas. The origin of this grid is positioned in the top left corner at coordinate (0,0). All elements are placed relative to this origin. So the position of the top left corner of the blue square becomes x pixels from the left and y pixels from the top, at coordinate (x,y). Later in this tutorial we'll see how we can translate the origin to a different position, rotate the grid and even scale it, but for now we'll stick to the default.

* Applying styles and colors :
In this example, we once again use two for loops to draw a grid of rectangles, each in a different color. The resulting image should look something like the screenshot. There is nothing too spectacular happening here. We use the two variables i and j to generate a unique RGB color for each square, and only modify the red and green values. The blue channel has a fixed value. By modifying the channels, you can generate all kinds of palettes. By increasing the steps, you can achieve something that looks like the color palettes Photoshop uses.

* Drawing text :
The canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text:

fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
example :
```
function draw() {
  var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
  ctx.font = '48px serif';
  ctx.fillText('Hello world', 10, 50);
}
```




## Cheats sheet :

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formaing words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.you just need to make a file with .md extension on Vs code and good to go with this cheats sheet:



 HEADERS : 

```

    # This is an <h1> tag
    ## This is an <h2> tag
    ##### This is an <h6> tag

```
list :
```
     orderd:
         1. Item 1
         2. Item 2
         3. Item 3
     unorder:    

         * Item 3a
         * Item 3b

 ```  
EMPHASIS :
```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_
**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__
*You **can** combine them*
```
BLOCKQUOTES :
```
> I’ve always been more interested
> in the future than in the past.
```
> I’ve always been more interested
> in the future than in the past.

## The seven rules of a great Git commit message:
* Keep in mind: This has all been said before.
* Separate subject from body with a blank line.
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
* Capitalize the subject line.
* Do not end the subject line with a period.
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
* Wrap the body at 72 characters.
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.
