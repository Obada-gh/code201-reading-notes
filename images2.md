## How the Web Works (visualization)
When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

## Structure : its the page how its looks these are main pionts you need to understand :
* There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.
* Ordered lists use numbers.
* Unordered lists use bullets.
* Definition lists are used to define terminology.
* Lists can be nested inside one another.

## Chapter 16: “Images” (pp.406-427)
* You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.
This is very helpful when you use the same sized
images on several pages of your site.
* Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically
using CSS.
* You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page.
* Background images can appear just once or be
repeated across the background of the box.
* You can create image rollover effects by moving the
background position of an image.
* To reduce the number of images your browser has to
load, you can create image sprites.

## Chapter 19: “Practical Information” (476-492)

* Search engine optimization helps visitors find your
sites when using search engines.
* Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to
see how many people visit your site, how they find it,
and what they do when they get there.
* To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a
domain name and web hosting.
* FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your
local computer to your web server.
* Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email
newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website
tools (to save you writing them from scratch).

## Cheats sheet :

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formaing words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.you just need to make a file with .md extension on Vs code and good to go with this cheats sheet:



 HEADERS : 

```

    # This is an <h1> tag
    ## This is an <h2> tag
    ##### This is an <h6> tag

```
list :
```
     orderd:
         1. Item 1
         2. Item 2
         3. Item 3
     unorder:    

         * Item 3a
         * Item 3b

 ```  
EMPHASIS :
```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_
**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__
*You **can** combine them*
```
