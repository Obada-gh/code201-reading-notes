# HTML Chapter 8: “Extra Markup” :

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the
`<!-- and -->` markers.
*  The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
*  The `<div>` and `<span>` elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
*  `<iframes>` cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
* The `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
*  Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.
