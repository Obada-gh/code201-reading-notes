## How the Web Works (visualization)
When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

## Structure : its the page how its looks these are main pionts you need to understand :
* There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.
* Ordered lists use numbers.
* Unordered lists use bullets.
* Definition lists are used to define terminology.
* Lists can be nested inside one another.

## Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175):
* Whenever you want to c XX ollect information from
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a
`<form>` element.
* Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
* Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.
* HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it
easier for visitors to fill in forms.

## Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms” (pp.330-357):

* In addition to the CSS p XX roperties covered in other
chapters which work with the contents of all elements,
there are several others that are specifically used to
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.
* List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.
* Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.
* Forms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.
* Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.

## Chapter 6: “Events” (pp.243-292):

* Events are the browser's way of indicating when
something has happened (such as when a page has
finished loading or a button has been clicked).
* Binding is the process of stating which event you are
waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting
for that event to happen upon.
* When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a
JavaScript function. When this function then changes
the web page in some way, it feels interactive because
it has responded to the user.
* You can use event delegation to monitor for events
that happen on all of the children of an element.
* The most commonly used events are W3C DOM
events, although there are others in the HTMLS
specification as well as browser-specific events.

## Cheats sheet :

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formaing words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.you just need to make a file with .md extension on Vs code and good to go with this cheats sheet:



 HEADERS : 

```

    # This is an <h1> tag
    ## This is an <h2> tag
    ##### This is an <h6> tag

```
list :
```
     orderd:
         1. Item 1
         2. Item 2
         3. Item 3
     unorder:    

         * Item 3a
         * Item 3b

 ```  
EMPHASIS :
```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_
**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__
*You **can** combine them*
```
BLOCKQUOTES :
```
> I’ve always been more interested
> in the future than in the past.

* Capitalize the subject line.
* Do not end the subject line with a period.
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
* Wrap the body at 72 characters.
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.
